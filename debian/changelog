debputy (0.1.48) unstable; urgency=medium

  * INTEGRATION-MODES.md: Correct `bullseye` that should have been `bookworm`
  * Also set PKG_CONFIG in the `perl-build` build system like with
    is done in the `perl-makemaker` build system.
  * Remove lintian-overrides since `debputy` no longer uses `dh`
  * d/control: Fix typo in description
  * debputy.pod: Document security aspects of `debputy lsp server`
    and `debputy lint`.
  * debputy: Fix inaccurate directory listing in an error message.
  * debputy: Ensure `u+rwX` as min mode when installing paths into the
    packages. This change prevent crashes when upstream has marked
    paths as read-only (such as `0444`).
    Thanks to Andrey Rakhmatullin <wrar@debian.org> (Closes: #1078906)
    Note: Paths can still get their user write bit removed via
    transformations or built-in rules (such as files in `etc/sudoers.d`
    which must be `0440`)
  * debputy: Require directory mode to always have `u+rwx`. Previously,
    only the `u+rx` mode was required. There is no known use-case for
    directories to not have a read, write and execute for the owner.

debputy (0.1.45) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest:
    - Add new `default-build-environment`, `build-environments` and `build-rules`
      for the new `full` integration mode where `debhelper` is no longer driving
      the build.
    - Port all `debhelper` provided build systems to have an native `debputy`
      counter part with a few tweaks.


  * LSP/Lint:
    - Add `xpm` as a known extension for packager files
    - Add `Build-Driver` as a known field for `debian/control`.
    - Add `Files-Excluded` and `Files-Included` as known fields for DEP-5
    - Quote values in completation items for the manifest. This means that
      the value for `manifest-version` is now properly YAML quoted.

  * debputy: Remove `--spellcheck` from "random" subcommands
  * debputy: Fix missing warning with `--debug` (it was supposed to be omitted,
    but never was due to exception flow).
  * debputy reformat: Fix bug where orphaned packages would have a style by
    default
  * doc: Document decision on plugin module import vs. initialization design
  * LSP/Lint: Fix crash with certain field being duplicated
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Fix wording
  * Add initial minimal `Build-Driver` support meaning that `debputy` can now use
    `dpkg-buildpackage`'s new `Build-Driver` support to drive the build without
    relying on `dh`. This requires bleeding edge features in `dpkg-buildpackage`
    and `debputy`.
  * Avoid stacktrace for CTRL + C during `run_command`
  * Improve error tracking related to plugins
  * Add remark about `env:` manifest variables sometimes respecting
    `build-environment`.

debputy (0.1.44) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP:
    - Provide hover docs for packages in relationship fields. Due to
      implementation limitations, OR relations (`foo | bar`) do not
      work. The hover doc relies on the system's APT cache with all
      the limitations from that (like the data not matching the target
      distribution)
    - Fix wording in the synopsis hover doc

  * debputy reformat: If possible provide the reformatting tool when the
    style cannot be applied.
  * debputy: Remove `printf` debug when log level is changed
  * debputy: Prefer using line numbers in error messages when available
  * editor-config: Improve the LSP config for `eglot`

    - Fix typo in diagnostic message
    - Reduce the number of false positive pkgfile typo warnings.
      Thanks to Otto Kekäläinen <otto@debian.org> (Closes: debputy#109)
    - Avoid recommending name segment for packaging files that do not
      support that.  Note all `debhelper` files currently "support"
      name segments as far as `debputy` can tell, since `dh_assistant`
      does not track this feature.

debputy (0.1.40) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest changes:
    - The manifest parser now validates the used features against the
      integration mode. This causes some invalid manifests to be
      detected at parse time (`debputy manifest`) rather than at
      build time for `dh-sequence-zz-debputy-rrr`).

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Use `dh_assistant` to determine inactive commands. This improves
      the check to cover commands that `debhelper` knows are inactive.
      However, the functionality now requires `debhelper (>= 13.15~)`.
    - Apply sequences from `debian/control` when analyzing `debian/rules`.
      Note for LSP: Depending on your editor, you may have to save
      `debian/control` first and then trigger a change in `debian/rules`
      for it to be visible. (Known issue, see debputy#103 and debputy#108)
    - Provide inlay hints for inherited fields in `debian/control`.
    - Provide integration mode level checks for most features. The
      capabilities on `path-metadata` is a known and notable case where
      the LSP/Lint side is silent where `debputy check-manifest` would
      complain.
    - Provide a warning for unknown capabilities (that `cap_from_text`
      does not recognize). Previously, this would only appear in
      `debputy check-manifest` or during builds.
    - Validate boolean and enum-like values for attributes of the
      manifest. These would previously only be caught by
      `debputy check-manifest` or during builds.

  * debputy: Remove internal `--integration-mode=rrr` option.
  * dh_debputy: Remove internal `--integration-mode=rrr` option.

  * debputy: `lsp features` now works even without minimum requires installed

debputy (0.1.38) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Avoid self-DOS when checking packaging file names
    - Perform more checks of packaging files
    - Ignore `fundamental` language ID (from `emacs`'s `fundamental-mode`)
  * debputy: Explicitly state how to see the editor snippets in the list of
    snippets
  * debputy: Special-case the file-level range in the output in the
    `junit4-xml` output format for `debputy lint`.
  * Fix matching of packager provided files for some corner cases. As a
    side-effect, some more corner cases of typos of the name stem are
    now detected by the LSP/Lint and annotate-debian-directory code
    when `python3-levenshtein` is installed. As an example,
    `foo.uxxr.service` can now be reported as a typo of `user.service`
    (for `dh_installsystemduser`) where it was previously considered a
    `service` file with a name segment of `uxxr` (for `dh_installsystemd`).
    Though, this only happens subcommands that active look for typos
    (such as the LSP/Lint part) and only when `python3-levenshtein` is
    enabled (check `debputy lsp features` for the `typo detection`).

debputy (0.1.37) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Provide `sort text` for some completion suggestions to have
      editors promote or demote certain values. Example being `allowed`,
      which is rarely used and is now demoted below other options.
    - Provide synopsis docs for various completion suggestions related
      to field values.
    - Provide a diagnostic for a "directory-only" match used in a
      `Files` field of `debian/copyright'.
    - Provide a diagnostic for `debhelper` config files and PPFs that
      uses a name segment without an explicit package prefix. These
      are possible typos of a real package name and additionally, they
      are deprecated in debhelper compat 14 (removal planned for compat
      15). Note that `debputy` did not allow name segments without
      explicit package prefix for the PPFs it supported, so this
      should only affect `debhelper` packages.
    - Provide a diagnostic for 'debhelper` config files and PPFs that
      used by commands not active in the `dh` sequence given the
      current set of add-ons. This only applies to packages using
      `dh` and relies 100% on `dh_assistant` providing useful data
      for the package in question. For this feature to work,
      `debhelper (>= 13.16~)` is needed. With older versions of
      `debhelper` the check is silently disabled.
    - Detect some typos in the "stem" part of debhelper config files
      and PPFs (both `debputy` and `debhelper` provided PPFs).
      Due to a technical limitation, the check only works when
      there is exactly one match for the stem within
      "typo edit distance". This means that typos of some stems
      are likely to be unreported. A trivial example is the
      typo `debian/dcos`, which is equally close to `debian/docs` and
      `debian/dirs`.


  * Update salsa CI configuration to better support backports
  * Fix bug in handling absence of `python3-lsprotocol` in unstable
  * Add missing help descriptions to `lint` and `reformat`
  * Add a `debian/clean` to remove files after "rules-less" experiments
  * debputy: `debputy lsp features` now reports if a newer version of
    `debhelper` would help or provide improve support. Currently, the
    lowest bound for passing is now `debhelper (>= 13.16~)`. The bound
    may be bumped in the future as the need arises.

debputy (0.1.36) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP/Lint: Basic detection of hook targets that will not be run
    with `debputy` sequences (debputy#103). Known issues are:
      - The check does not account for sequences loaded via
        `debian/rules`.
      - The diagnostics does not automatically refresh in the
        language server when changing `debian/control`. The work
        around is to do a minor change to `debian/rules` to
        re-trigger it.
  * Internal refactoring of linter and LSP to make it easier to
    make some build-dependencies fully optional, which in turn
    makes backporting `debputy` to bookworm-backports a lot easier.
  * debian/control: Mark some build-dependencies unnecessary for
    bookworm-backports via a package specific build profile.

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Manifest:
    - Fix inverted boolean logic causing `path-metadata` to reject matched
      directories when it should have allowed the match.

  * LSP/Lint:
    - In regex based validation, ignore values with substvars to avoid
      false positives.
    - Fix typo in hover doc
    - Fix two minor bugs (an out of bounds and None exception)
    - Avoid double colon when completion YAML keys and there was already
      a colon.
    - Fix a bug where the YAML completion would not work properly if there was
      any content on the line after the current line.


  * debputy: Considerably reduce the output during package build by:
    - Do not announce loading of bundled plugins
    - Avoid unnecessary output related to installations (like search dir and
      discard rules) for `rrr` integration mode.
    - Reduce the log level to `warning` by default from info (other subcommands
      still start on `info` level by default). In the `debhelper` integration
      modes, `export DH_VERBOSE=1` will restore the `info` level logging.
    - Guard some information (such as most commands being run) beyond info
      logging.

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Improve Synopsis hover docs by using a wording closer to
      DevRef 6.2.2 and provide a reference example for comparison.
    - Detect some issues with the Synopsis of package description.
      Example include detecting known placeholders, the synopsis being
      too short (single word), and the synopsis starting with an
      article.
    - Avoid emitting diagnostic for missing `Standards-Version` when
      the source package only produces `udebs`.
    - Limit diagnostics of `debian/changelog` to the first two issues
      (Closes: debputy#92)
    - The `black` style no longer normalizes stanza order. Instead,
      current order is preserved as-is.
    - Fix negated architectures being considered a typo. This is a quick
      fix that side-steps the issue. However, the current solution should
      be replaced by a specialized diagnostic logic for `Architecture`.
      Thanks to
      Picca Frédéric-Emmanuel <frederic-emmanuel.picca@synchrotron-soleil.fr>
      for reporting the issue.

  * debputy: Support `junit` report format for the `lint` subcommand.
    (Closes: debputy#99)
  * d/control: Have `dh-debputy` provide `debputy` for now to simplify
    installation. The documentation still uses `dh-debputy` until such
    a time where it makes sense to create a standalone `debputy` package.

debputy (0.1.33) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Check `Files` in debian/copyright for unnecessary syntactical segments.
    - Add basic validation of `Standards-Version` field (like out of date
      Standards-Version or incorrect format)
    - Add support for `debian/patches/series`. Note that for the LSP support
      you will probably need `--ignore-language-ids` for it to activate.
      Current features are:
      + Semantic tokens: Comments + Patches (as "String") are matched.
        Some patch options are marked too.
      + Diagnostics: Patches not mentioned, non-existent patches, duplicate
        patches, patches not ending with .diff/.patch (to aid editor
        support), and syntax issues.
      + Completion: Patch names are completed. Option completion is not
        supported (but `debian/patches/series` only allows `-p1` which
        is redundant).
    - Packages with multiple `Vcs-*` fields (ignoring `Vcs-Browser`) now
      triggers a diagnostic.
    - Linter (but not LSP) now has a separate severity for spelling issues
      called `spelling`. It works like the previous severity for all intents
      and purposes, it is just a different name for the same severity.

  * d/control: Bump Standards-Version to 4.7.0 - no changes required

    - Improve semantic token support for deb822 files to cover react
      to known values, inter-stanza comments, field comments and in-field

      the `Source` field of `debian/control`.
    - Provide specialized hover docs for `debian/control` that provides
      specialized help for the synopsis part of the `Description` field.

debputy (0.1.27) unstable; urgency=medium

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Disable automatic syntax check of makefiles (`debian/rules`)
      by default. The `make` man page strongly implies that it "may"
      run code, which will be unhelpful to anyone using `debputy lint`
      to review packages.
    - The `debputy.manifest` diagnostics now flag conflicting
      attributes in the manifest. Previously, these were only flagged
      by `debputy check-manifest` or during build.  (Closes: #85)
    - When there is a typo of a keyword in `debputy.manifest` with one
      obvious solution, the linting will continue linting based on
      the corrected key rather than the original key.
    - Improve the `debputy.manifest` diagnostics to cover deeper into
      the manifest. Among other, it now offers some validation of
      `ManifestCondition` (`when:`).

  * LSP/lint:
    - Make debputy.manifest completer better at accounting for conflicting
      keywords such as `as` vs. `sources` in `install`.
    - The debputy.manifest completer now provides completions in more cases.
    - Add basic support `debian/tests/control`. Note that `elpa-dpkg-dev-el`
      does not support it yet in unstable (in git, expected to be 37.22) and
      `vim` does not seem  to have support for it.

  * migrate-from-dh:

  * LSP/lint:
    - Provide initial hover docs for `d/debputy.manifest`.
    - Provide initial completion support for `d/debputy.manifest`.
    - Provide more diagnostics for `d/debputy.manifest`. Note that
      `debputy check-manifest` still covers a lot more, but it usually
      only reports one issue at the time and does not work with the LSP.
    - When the editor does not provide a language id for the files,
      `debputy` now attempts to guess the language from the filename.
      This makes the language server work with most editors that do
      not know about the file format (such as `debian/debputy.manifest`).

debputy (0.1.24) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest:
    - Add new keyword `services` under `packages.foo`, where the
      packager can specify whether a given service or (systemd) unit
      should be enabled/started on installation and how upgrades
      should be managed. With this, more packages using
      `dh_installsystemd` and `dh_installinit` can hopefully now use
      `debputy`. Note user services is mentioned in the manifest
      feature, but `debputy` does not actually detect any user
      services.

  * Plugin API:
    - Detect duplicate service registrations and error out when
      detected. The API is private, so it will not affect any
      plugins outside `debputy`.

  * debputy: Service maintscript snippets are now run in "service" order
  * autopkgtests: Run `debputy lint` with the linter exit code
  * debputy: Fix crash on re-encoding compressed man pages.

  * debputy: Enable `lint` to run with invalid `debian/control` file.
    As example, if a package stanza is missing the `Architecture`
    field or is syntactically invalid, then the linter will now still
    run and report this linting errors (rather than `debputy` hard
    stopping on the first issue).

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Fix bug where some dh config lines were migrated wrong

  * LSP/Lint:
    - Provide better "guards" for `debian/rules` and `debputy.manifest`.
      Since the LSP is accepting generic languages here for compatibility,
      it should not apply to all instances of those generic languages.
    - Add basic semantic token and folding range support for comments
      in deb822 based files.
    - Detect and leverage trivial cases of `dh ... --with addon` for
      better precision.
    - Fix the quick fix handler in LSP mode. It was disabled by mistake
      due to some refactoring.
    - Add some basic checks of the changelog sign off dates.

  * CLI Breaking change: Rename `plugable` to `pluggable` in API
    and command line interface. The relevant API is currently
    "private-only", which is why this is not listed under a
    "Plugin API" heading.

  * d/control: Add 3.11 version bound on python for now
  * Improve migration from `dh` related documentation.

    - VirtualPath API: The `lookup` method now resolves symlinks if
      necessary
    - VirtualPath API: Provide `interpreter` method to resolve the
      interpreter of a file (based on the `#!`-line).

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Support different integration levels using the new --migration-target
      option with defaults derived from existing packaging where possible.

  * debputy: Code better with faulty optional plugins (Closes: debputy#73)
  * README.md: Document communication channels
  * debputy: Accept usr/lib/MA/Package as private python dir
  * debputy: Provide `plugin {list,show} type-mappings` subcommand
  * debputy: Preserve name of mapped type in most cases for plugin show p-m-r
  * d/changelog: Typo fixes and re-align some entries that were "too long".
  * Preserve mtime from ref_path where possible
  * Fix bug where `binary-version` from the manifest was not used
  * Add minimal `R³ dh` integration mode for `util-linux` and other packages
    that want to migrate away from `fakeroot`.  Use
    `debputy migrate-from-dh --migration-target dh-sequence-zz-debputy-rrr`
    to get migration aid for this integration mode.
  * debputy: Make `mtime` resolution more robust (Closes: debputy#75)
  * Auto-correct common interpreters
  * Update handling of `t64:Provides` to match debhelper
  * debputy: Fix crash bug when packages did not use debhelper
  * debputy: Avoid passing the substvars file to dh_gencontrol for -dbgsym
    packages
  * debputy: Automatically apply relationship substvars. See
    https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2024/03/msg00030.html for
    details.
  * debputy: Use `shlibs:Pre-Depends` by default for essential packages
  * Implement initial Language Server based on `pygls` and linter.  With this
    comes the following new subcommands:
    - `debputy lsp server` starts the language server to support editors
      with Debian packaging files.
    - `debputy lsp editor-config NAME` provides config snippets for
      known editors.
    - `debputy lsp features` provides a human readable list of features
      and language IDs currently supported. Mostly useful for people
      trying to determine what to put in their editor config where
      `debputy lsp editor-config` cannot help them.
    - `debputy lint` provides a "batch" (non-interactive) version of
      the diagnostics that `debputy lsp server` provides for the case
      where you want these without an editor as intermediate (or
      where you editor does not support LSP).

    Most of these features will require optional dependencies. Check the
    Recommends and Suggests for packages that may be relevant for you.
    The `debputy` man page has a section on how `debputy lint` relates
    to other tools such as `debputy lsp` and `lintian`.

  * Vendor a copy of the `python-debian` RTS parser until the relevant
    features are merged into `python-debian`.

debputy (0.1.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Plugin API:
    - Support cross package content checks in metadata detectors.
      The feature prevents the metadata detector from "unsafe"
      access to other packages. As an example, arch:any packages
      can never see the content for arch:all packages (since
      they are not always built together).

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Add migration support for the `sodeps` sequence along with its
      related `so:Depends` substvar.

  * debputy: Support the `X-Time64-Compat` field as used by `debhelper`
  * debputy: Tweak wording of automatic-discard-rules examples in
    the output of `debputy plugin show a-d-r ...`.
  * debputy: Accessibility related changes:
    - Add CSV output for *human* consumption on many of the plugin
      list commands. This enables easier consumption for screen
      readers when the user wants structured data. Note the CSV
      is *not* guaranteed to remain stable for scripting purposes.
    - Do not describe the table for screen readers. Instead,
      generate the ASCII table again but without the divider
      lines, which would just be line noise.
    - Revert on URL rewriting of man pages for screen readers. For now
      also disable creating urls when the link text is not equal to
      the url as it is not clear how the screen reader reacts to the
      hyperlinks.
  * debputy: Fix automatic pager feature not working as intended.
    This was a regression in the previous release.
  * debputy.pod: Improve `debputy` man page. Among other,
    document more subcommands. Example, `migrate-from-dh` was
    not documented previously.
  * debputy: Provide a better error message for
    `--plugin ./fake/debputy.json`.  It never worked and now you
    just get a better error message than `debputy` saying that
    `debputy` was already loaded.
  * debputy: Support bug#950723 style pkgfiles when `dh_assistant`
    announces it for `annotate-debian-directory`.
  * debputy: Fallbackless only applies to files without an explicit
    package. Unclear whether it could be abused or cause issues.
  * debputy: Make ASCII list headers bold face for terminal output.
  * debputy: Generate `libfooX (= ${binary:Version})` `misc:Depends`
    via libfoo.so symlink. This largely replaces `dh_sodeps.
  * d/changelog: Fix typo in a previous entry.

debputy (0.1.19) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Plugin API:
    - Breaking change (JSON-only): Group reference documentation
      attributes for packager provided files under the new
      `reference-documentation` attribute.

  * debputy: Fix double inverted boolean
  * debputy: Improve the command output in multiple ways
    - When users set `OPTIMIZE_FOR_SCREEN_READER=1`, `debputy` now
      prints less visualization. Notably, ASCII formatting such as
      underlying is removed. Some commands now also uses a more
      textual description rather than a visual output. As the
      poster example, compare `debputy plugin show a-d-r la-files`
      with and without this option.
    - Documentation URLs are now rendered as clickable links for
      terminal emulators that support the relevant ANSI escape
      sequence. When optimizing output for screen readers,
      `man:name(section)` URIs are unconditionally written to
      their `https://manpages.debian.org/name.section` as man pages
      are generally not working very well with screen readers
      unlike HTML based documentation.
    - With `python3-colors`, output now uses a bit more
      formatting such as boldface text when outputting to a
      terminal.
  * debputy: Fix crash when doing `annotate-debian-directory` on a
    `debputy`-based package
  * d/changelog: Document plugin API change in 0.1.18
  * Move `lua` plugin into a separate folder to avoid failing in

  * Plugin API:
    - Packager Provided Files can now reference documentation
      in the form of a generic description and URIs documenting
      the file format.

  * Plugins:
    - Add `perl-openssl` plugin to mirror `dh-perl-openssl`.

  * debputy: Refactor to make root level partly introspectable
  * migrate-from-dh: Avoid asking users to remove Build-Depends
    on dh sequences that are replaced. This is because they often
    also provide relevant dependencies that the `debputy` plugin
    dependency cannot provide (as long as the plugin is provided
    by `dh-debputy`).
  * Added partial migration of the `dh-lua` sequence. It is not
    installed because the `lua` debhelper build system uses
    build-time `d/pkg.install` files, which are not supported
    by `debputy`. Omitted the migration code for `lua` as it
    would just lead to false-hopes and broken hearts!
  * debputy: Provide a `show` for packager provided files
  * debputy: Provide a `used-packager-provided-files` list topic
  * debputy: Add new `tool-support` command with the following

      documentation URIs. Data partly sourced from plugins and
      from `dh_assistant`. Output is always JSON.
    - export-reference-data: Provides access to reference data
      used in other commands. Outputs text by default, but
      supports `--output-format=json` for json exports.
    - supports-tool-command: Test whether a particular
      `tool-support` command is supported (without having to
      parse `--help` output).

    for when a plugin does not provide any (online) documentation.
  * debputy: Refactored some internals to add a (non-public) plugin
    infrastructure for adding parsing hooks to `packages.<PKG>`.
    As a side-effect:
    - `debputy plugin list/show p-m-r` can now access and describe these
      hooks.
    - The `show` output for these rules that reference certain other
      rules now report them by their type name. As an example,
      `when` is now described as a `ManifestCondition` rather than
      `string or mapping`. This provides better traceability between
      the rules.
  * debputy: Fix bug in generated scripts for `clean-after-removal`
    where a start quote (`"`) was missing.
  * debputy: Fix bug where Installed-Size was wrong for -dbgsym packages

  * THANKS.md: Acknowledge Paul Gevers for his early adoption and
    testing.
  * debputy: Incomplete support for `dh_installdebconf`. Any debconf
    templates (such as `debian/templates`) will now be processed and
    lead to a `DEBIAN/templates` file in the resulting deb and the
    `postrm` will run `db_purge` on `purge`. However, it is not possible
    to provide a `DEBIAN/config` or custom `postinst` snippets leveraging

  * manifest:
    - Breaking change: The `discard` rule must now match at least one
      path by default when it applies to at least one existing
      search directory.
    - Breaking change: Renamed `when` to `required-when` for `discard`
      rules. The name better reflects that the `discard` rule is
      always applied. The conditional decides whether it is an error
      for a path to match nothing
    - Support `**/non-glob` as a basename match.  This form must use
      the leading `**/` part to be a basename match. Without the leading
      `**/`, the pattern would be interpreted as an exact path match
      for a top-level file/directory.

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - List `dh_install` as replaced which ensures `debputy` will
      detect overrides/hook targets for `dh_install`.

  * Manifest:

      the discarding applies too.
    - Added new `multi-dest-install` rule for the rare case where a
      package needs to install the same source *twice*.  This was needed
      for `kafs-client`.  (Closes: debputy#66)
    - Any `udeb` packages are ignored when install-doc (etc.) evaluates
      default for `into`. This means if a source package only builds a
      single `deb` plus one or more `udeb`s, then `into` is now optional

debputy (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Plugin API:
    - Test API: Breaking change. Make metadata related tests stateless
    - `VirtualPath` API: Add an `is_executable` property

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Assume minimum compat of 12 for all packages now to match the
      `dh_installinit` mechanics that `debputy` now perform when an
      `init` script is present.

  * d/control: Use `Debian-based` in the description to appease lintian
  * d/control: Canonicalize the URL in the Vcs-Browser field
  * d/control: Use `debputy@packages.debian.org` as maintainer address
  * debputy: Tweak wording for several error messages
  * Add initial support for service management.  It covers the default
    flow of `dh_installinit` and `dh_installsystemd`. Notably, the
    `dh_installsystemduser` is *not* covered.
  * Fix bug in `install-man` rule that made it unusable
  * Internal refactoring (notably of the installation rules code).

debputy (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest:
    - Breaking change: Correct spelling of `build-profiles-matches`
      so it now matches the documentation.
    - The `install-docs` rule now supports `dest-dir` and `as`. Its
      default `dest-dir` remains the same.
    - Provide `path:GNU_INFO_DIR` manifest variable that represents
      the directory where GNU info files should be installed into.

  * Plugin API:
    - VirtualPath now supports `open` with buffering.
    - When declaring manifest snippets, automatically pick up
      `FileSystemMatchRule` (and subclasses) up as `path hints` (used
      to provide context for error messages)

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Improve some error messages to provide the actual file path
      instead on an internal object name/id.
    - Fix detection of `dh-exec` conditionals that could cause the
      conditions to be interpreted as literal values rather than
      conditionals.
    - Support `dh-exec` conditionals in `d/install`.
    - Provide more support for dh-exec features in d/manpages. Notably,
      `SOURCE => DEST` is now rewritten into an `install-doc` (with `as`)
      rule and conditionals are now supported.
    - Multiple conditions in `d/links` files are now supported
      and will be translated into an `all-of`.
    - Avoid single-item `sources` for migrated bash-completions.
      (Style-only change)
    - Create a placeholder variable for unknown manifest variables.
      Previously, it would result in a hard error as the resulting
      manifest could not be parsed. (Closes: debian/debputy#65)
    - Support migrating `d/info` files

  * debputy: Convert transformation and install rules to using
    `FileSystemMatchRule`s for paths.  This unifies parsing of globs for
    all rules except `clean-after-removal` (which still uses shell glob
    semantics).
  * online doc for path-metadata: Fix copy-paste mistake
  * Fix crash bug where `d/tmp` is not a directory but an install rule is
    used (unclear if this was reproducible in older versions).
  * debputy: Fix internal error by `debputy` setting wrong "CoW"-flag on
    some paths
  * d/changelog: Clarify wording of a previous entry and fix a few typos.
  * debputy: Correct two error messages that should have shown valid attribute
    names when incorrect values were provided.
  * debputy: Fix bug in parsing of `all-of` and `any-of` manifest conditions
    that made it impossible to use these manifest conditions.
  * tests: Provide initial tests of basic install rules. Required some
    refactoring related to the virtual file system to support these
    tests.

debputy (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest changes:
    - Support `clean-after-removal` feature, where you can ask
      `debputy` to remove files when the package has been removed
      or is being purged.  This feature is similar in spirit to
      `rpm`'s `%ghost` files.  (Closes: debputy#35)


  * plugin API: Fix bug where `path.chmod("symbolic-mode")` would
    raise an exception
  * debputy: Defer error'ing out when dpkg-gensymbols returns with a non-zero
    exit code until all packages have been processed
  * debputy: Optimize materialization to require less copying via
    the following features:
    - Properly implement lazy copy-on-write actions to avoid
      copying a file into the scratch directory only to copy it
      to the materialization directory later.  Now, the case
      only performs one copy (directly from the source to the
      materialization directory).
    - When a file has already been copied into the scratch
      directory because `debputy` needed to mutate the file,
      use a `mv` rather than a `cp` to move the file to its
      final destination.

debputy (0.1.9.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Support full migration of `dh-sequence-numpy3`. Though, there
      is still no `dh-sequence-python3` migration support, which
      may make this less useful at the moment.
  * tests: Fix bug where `debputy` provided plugins fails in
    installed mode causing `debputy` autopkgtests to fail.
  * tests: Improve test coverage for gnome plugin.

debputy (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Plugin changes:
    - Breaking change: The features of the `bash-completion`
      plugin has been embedded into the `debputy` plugin.  The
      `bash-completion` plugin has been removed without a
      backwards compatibility feature.
    - Breaking change (test-api): The `virtual_path` function
      got renamed to `virtual_path_def` and got promoted to
      the non-test API.
    - Add more features to the `VirtualPath` API.  Notably some
      mutations are now supported when the file system is in
      read-write mode.
    - InstallRule's no longer accept an explicit search dir.
      Search dir handling is now done differently and plugins
      are not involved in that process.

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Support full migration of `dh-sequence-bash-completion`.
    - Support partial migration of `dh-sequence-gnome`.  The
      `dh_gnome` side will be migrated, but `dh_gnome_clean`
      will still be done via the `dh-sequence-gnome`.
    - List which `dh-sequence-X` Build-Dependencies should be
      removed. These are listed as manual migrations.
    - Migration now detects *simple* cases of `dh` addons
      loaded via `--with` in `debian/rules`.

  * Let `debputy` handle loading of additional variables
  * d/changelog: Reformat line in the 0.1.8 entry
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Correct name of two example manifest variables
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Improve documentation related to manifest variables
  * Add private plugin api for package processors and migrate some
    `debputy` code to use this feature.
  * debputy: Provide a `clean .la files` feature by default based on a
    similar feature from `dh_gnome`.
  * debputy: Filter out doxygen related cruft (replacing `dh_doxygen`)
  * Make discard rules a plugin provided feature (currently private)
    and provide (validated) examples for automatic discard rules.
    These can be seen via the example command:
      `debputy plugin list a-d-r doxygen-cruft-files`
  * debputy: Show which paths have been matched by an automatic discard
    rule in the build out along with how to override them.

 -- Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net>  Sun, 26 Nov 2023 15:20:44 +0100

debputy (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest changes:
    - Breaking change: Rename some manifest variables like `{{TAB}}`
      `{{token:TAB}}`. This change only affects manifest variables
      intended to provide textual tokens that might be hard to write
      literally or to avoid triggering substitution of another manifest
      variable.
    - Split `arch-matches` condition into three.  The `arch-matches`
      is still preferred. The other two variants are for special-cases
      related to cross-building. As a side-effect of this change,
      `arch-matches` can now be used in source context.
    - Support manifest declared variables.  A new `definitions.variables`
      key is defined where variables can be declared. See
      MANIFEST-FORMAT.md for the details. (Closes: debputy#58)
    - It is now possible to use substitution variables in package names
      in the manifest. This enables the use of `libfoo{{SONAME}}` instead
      of hard-coding the value.

  * Plugin changes:
    - Breaking change: Remove the previously required plugin-version
      attribute.
    - Streamline installation process for "simple" `debputy` plugins by
      providing a debhelper tool and by having `debputy` take
      responsibility for the Python byte-compilation requirement for
      `debputy` plugins. Additionally, support for running plugin tests
      have been added too (both as build-time and as installed tests).
    - Breaking (test-only) change: The test API for loading plugins have
      been renamed and should no longer be passed a JSON descriptor file.
      Instead, the test framework will attempt to find the JSON descriptor
      file on its own. With this method, the test does not have to
      distinguish between install-time and build-time test runs.
    - A metadata detector can now request the binary package version
      of a package via the context parameter.
    - Plugins can now provide literal manifest variables like `path:FOO_DIR`.

  * debputy: Provide online documentation for most manifest rules
  * debputy: Correct detection of required/conditional fields in
    `plugin show pmr`
  * debputy: Provide "on-line" documentation of manifest conditions
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Correct some anchors that would cause broken links
    in HTML rendered versions of the file.
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Clarify `replacement-rule` for `create-symlink` only
    applies if the declared symlink path exists. If it does not exist and
    cannot be because it would require a non-directory to become a directory,
    then `replace-rule` cannot be used.
  * plugin changes: Make single-file Python module easier to provide
  * debputy: Add `--plugin` parameter to load plugins for most commands.
  * debputy: Fix bug where some common args were ignored depending on argument
    order.
  * dh_installdebputy: New helper to install `debputy` plugins from
    debhelper packages.
  * d/control: Have `dh-debputy` provide `dh-sequence-installdebputy`.
  * dh-sequence-debputy: Restore `dh_installdir` command.  This enables packages
    to still use the `dh_installdir` helper to work around upstreams that does
    assumes install directories exist (such as `DEST_DIR`).
  * debputy: Support d/alternatives files like `dh_installalternatives`.
  * Provide basic plugin to support d/bash-completion files. The feature is
    deliberately written as a stand-alone plugin, so it is easier to migrate
    to the `bash-completion` package later if that is relevant.
  * GETTING-STARTED-WITH-dh-debputy.md: List `dh_installalternatives` as a
    replaced command.  It has been replaced for quite a while and the omission
    in the docs was unintentional.
  * Provide basic bash-completion plugin and provide migrations for the
    users of `dh-sequence-bash-completion`.
  * d/tests/control: Add explicit test dependency on python3-all
    (Closes: #1056240)
  * debputy: Provide a `plugin list manifest-variables` subcommand that will
    list known variables.  Default special-case and token manifest variables
    are hidden and have to be requested explicitly.
  * debputy: Provide a `plugin show manifest-variables VAR` subcommand that
    will show information about a given manifest variable.
  * Breaking change: Plugins can now provide manifest variables
  * d/changelog: Bump snapshot version

debputy (0.1.7.8) unstable; urgency=medium

    - Breaking change: The `remove` transformation now prunes empty
      dirs by default.  The previous behaviour can be restored with
      an explicit `keep-empty-parent-dirs: true`.

  * d/tests/debputy-py.test: Fix bugs in autopkgtest
  * debputy: Provide new `plugable-manifest-rules` topic for `plugin list`.
    This subcommand enables the user to get a list of all rules available
    under `installations` or `packages.{{PACKAGE}}.transformations`, etc.
    (Note: it was renamed to `pluggable-manifest-rules` in 0.1.22)
  * debputy: Provide a `plugin show plugable-manifest-rules` command that
    can provide some details about each rule (such as `install`).
    (Note: it was renamed to `pluggable-manifest-rules` in 0.1.22)
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Clarify some of the "shell"-like examples.
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Clarify that "install" (with `as`) behaves like
    `foo => bar`. Previously, the documentation said `=>` which could also
    cover the `=> bar` feature from `dh-exec`.  However, that feature is
    handled by the `installations` itself rather than "install" (with
    `as`).
  * d/tests/control: Add superficial test of `debputy` command line

  * debputy: Fix crash on octal mode being specified as an int.
    Thanks to Paul Gevers <elbrus@debian.org> (Closes: debputy#54)
  * debputy: Ensure dh-integration based scratch (temp) dir is used when called
    from dh_debputy. This ensures that `dh_clean` will always clean up after
    `debputy` when `debputy` is used with `debhelper`.
  * debputy: Resolve variables when processing `as` in `install` rules.

debputy (0.1.7.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Manifest changes:
    - Implement substitution in symlink target.  Thanks to Paul Gevers
      for reporting the issue. (Closes: debputy#56)
    - Add `replacement-rule` parameter to `create-symlink`. With the
      `replacement-rule` parameter, you can control how `debputy`
       should react to the `path` of a symlink clashing with an
       existing file system object.  The default behavior remains
       unchanged.

  * migrate-from-dh:
    - Merge more `debian/install` rules.  Most install rules from
      `dh_install` will now be grouped by `dest-dir`. There are a few
      special-cases, where merging is not applied (`=> usr/bin/foo`)
      and probably will not be.

debputy (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

  * Manifest changes:
    - Breaking change: `path-metadata` rules never match symlinks.
      Previously, you could match symlinks when ownership information
      was changed. However, there is no known case in Debian where this
      feature would be useful. To keep the logic and documentation simple,
      symlinks are now no longer matched.

  * Plugin API changes:
    - Breaking change: Rewrite the API declaring packager provided files to
      use a full path format rather than dir + basename.
    - Breaking change: The directory `/usr/share/debputy/debputy/plugins` is
      now the official plugin directory. Previously, it was not explicitly
      defined (but ended up being `/usr/share/dh-debputy/plugins`).
    - It is now possible declare packager provided files in the plugin json
      file (that is, without needing any python code at all).

  * Changes related to `migrate-from-dh`:
    - Remove the `systemd` dh addon from the list of supported add-on. The
      addon implies compat 10 and `debputy` assumes compat 11 at least.
      Users are better off migrating to compat 11 and then to `debputy`.
    - When generating an updated manifest, the migration will now verify
      that the generated manifest can be parsed. If not, `debputy` will
      raise an internal error promoting the user to file a bug.

  * Parse plugin json via the declarative parser
  * debputy: Avoid stacktrace if run outside package root
  * debputy: Support running some subcommands outside of source roots
  * IMPLEMENTATION-DECISIONS.md: Document some decisions behind plugin integration
  * debputy: Package builds and `check-manifest` now only loads explicitly
    requested plugins to ensure deterministic behaviour.  Other commands (notably
    the `plugin`) still loads all plugins that `debputy` can find.  Plugins are
    "explicitly requested" when the package has a `Build-Depends` on
    `debputy-plugin-X` where `X` is the name of the plugin.
  * MIGRATING-A-DH-PLUGIN.md: Advice against providing Python-based plugins for
    now as the logistics are not fully prepared.
  * debputy: Pipe to pager for some subcommands (such as
    `debputy plugin list ppf`), if `DEBPUTY_PAGER` or `PAGER` is set, or if `less`
    is available in `PATH`. The `LESS` variable is set to `-FRSXMQ` if not set.
  * debputy: Show where the plugin is installed when listing plugins
    (`debputy plugin list`)
  * debputy: Provide more details in `debputy plugin list ppf`
  * debputy: Restore ability to build packages with non-root static ownership.
    There was a regression in a recent release that made `debputy` not realize
    it would need to account for `(fake)root`.
  * debputy: Provide better error message when plugin JSON is invalid.
    Previously, you would just get a stack trace.
  * Support sub-second mtime in the intermediate manifest
  * debputy: Preserve `mtime` for compressed files like `gzip` does.
  * debputy: Reduce the number of `stat`s when performing installations.
  * debputy: Align changelog trimming closer with `debhelper` to minimize any
    diffs between a `debhelper` produced deb and a `debputy` produced deb.
  * debputy: Fix a cache retention issue that caused `Installed-Size` to be
    wrong some cases.

debputy (0.1.6) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Manifest changes:
    - Breaking change: Replace `exclude` with `discard` and remove inline
      `exclude` rule
    - Breaking change: Rename `exclude` (transformation) to `remove`
    - Breaking change: Symlink creation is now a transformation rule
    - Breaking change: Empty directory creation is now a transformation rule
    - Permit str/list forms of current install rules
    - Support `install-man` rule similar to `dh_installman`.  Note that
      `install-man` does *not* automatically fallback to guessing the
      language from the basename like `dh_installman`. The feature is
      supported but requires explicit opt-in.

  * Changes related to `migrate-from-dh`:
    - Fix invalid error message on `${env:FOO}` variables
    - The migration tool is now more clear on "unsupported" vs. "supported but
      there is no automatic migration feature".  The former will require an
      explicit "I know and I am ignoring it" parameter, whereas the latter
      gets a "manual migration" warning.
    - Automatic migration from `d/manpages` to the new `install-man` rule.  Be
      sure to double-check the `language` attribute (of lack thereof).  You may
      need to add `language: derive-from-basename` in some cases.
    - Automatic migration to translate `debian/not-installed` into `discard`
      rules.
    - The migration tool now detects unsupported dh sequence add-ons used.
    - The migration tool now detects missing `dh-sequence-debputy` (or the `-zz-`
      variant) in the Builds-Depends and provides you with a warning.

  * Plugin API changes:
    - `VirtualPath` now has a new `open` method.

  * d/changelog: Correct a `Closes` to specific it was a gitlab issue
  * IMPLEMENTATION-DECISIONS.md: New file that document some implementation
    decisions in a new document.
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Tweak some wording and remove an invalid exclude example
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Clarify that conditions may partially evaluate rules
  * Parse transformation rules via declarative parsers.  Same behaviour, just
    with better error messages.
  * Set `DPKG_NLS=0` when calling `dpkg-architecture`
  * FSPath: Support tracking ownership and rewrite mode tracking
  * Remove internal `show-manifest-rules` command
  * Avoid crash if two ELF binaries have the same build-id
  * Support running `dwz` for ELF binaries
  * GETTING-STARTED-WITH-dh-debputy.md: Improve migration section
  * Correct python public directory detection.  Previously, if the debug
    version of the directory was available, only that was checked for
    python scripts.  Now `debputy` checks both directories when they are
    both present.
  * Remove shlibs + symbols migration code it is no longer necessary.
  * migration: Fix `min` that should have been `max` causing it to use the
    min dh-compat level rather than the max compat level required by
    migrations.
  * migrate-from-dh: Detect unsupported dh-addons and missing debputy B-D
  * debputy: Clarify that `plugin list --help` will list topics
  * Remove support for `menutest` and `isinstallable` scripts for now.
    There is no support for the deb maintscripts. It seems weird to have
    support for the udeb ones.
  * Generate the control root in a tempdir to reset state between runs.
  * shlibs.py: Fix crash when no `shlibs` and `symbols` files were provided
  * Generate temp names with `__` separating the original basename for making
    the original basename a little easier to spot.
  * Fix bug where perl shebang lines were always rewritten
  * debputy: Provide better contextual error messages
  * Default most scripts with shebang lines to 755 if no other rule matches it.
    This applies to any file having /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, or /sbin
    in its #!-line, where a more specific rule does not apply.

debputy (0.1.5) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New migration features:
    - Lower the min dh compat to 11 for the simplest cases.  Some cases
      will require higher compat levels (notably, any arch:any packages bumps
      the minimum to compat 12).

  * debputy: Breaking change:  Detect missing installation rules for `debian/tmp`
    similar to `dh_missing`. The `debputy` detects completely directories as
    possible integration points and provides a bit of context to what kind of
    path entry the missing file system object is.  The new install-time `exclude`
    rule can be used to deliberately ignore uninteresting path objects that is
    this feature detects.

  * Manifest changes:
    - Breaking change: Make `all-of` and `any-of` consistent (case-wise) with
      other conditions.
    - The `into` key on installation rules are now optional for single binary
      packages.
    - Fix bug where `dest-dir`, `as` and `when` was ignored for `install` (etc.)
    - Support symbolic mode for mode attributes in additional to octal modes.
    - Support `exclude` as an install rule (under `installations`) as an
      experimental feature.
    - Support `exclude` as an inline attribute in some `install` rules.

  * Fix error in built-in permission normalization rule that broke directory modes
    in some cases.
  * Support main-doc package in install rules and apply_compression
  * Remove support for debian/udev as it involves `/lib` and `debputy` should not
    be involved in the `/usr-merge` transition.
  * util.py: Fix bug in detect_fakeroot that would neuter the check
  * util.py: Implement an xargs-like interface
  * highlevel_manifest_parser.py: Prettify the definition reference
  * highlevel_manifest_parser.py: Detect typos if python3-levenshtein is installed
  * Remove debug symbols from static libraries (Closes: debputy#32)
  * Remove remaining code for supporting "install"- and "mtree"-like formats.
  * Provide a new declarative parser and migrate installation rules to use it.
  * Replace internal attribute path tracking strings with the new AttributePath
    class.
  * Improve handling of installation rules that are disabled by conditionals.
  * Ensure binNMU changelogs are split out of the main changelog
    (Closes: debputy#34)
  * Use declarative parser as a subparser for more parts of the manifest
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Installations is now its own top level section
  * Generate `${t64:Provides}` for the t64 migration (Closes: debputy#37)
  * Fix invalid root dir for multi-binary packages
  * MANIFEST-FORMAT.md: Write a conflict rule to apply to `installations` too.
  * Avoid assertion error when `owning-package` was used without
    `prior-to-version`.
  * Support bash-completion via python3-argcomplete. For now, this must be
    activated manually via `eval "$(register-python-argcomplete debputy)"`.  It is
    a bit slow due to start up times not being optimized for this case.
  * Breaking change: Rewrite command line handling to remove special case options
    (such as `-p`) from the root level.  On the other hand, the new logic supports
    providing default options on all subparsers, enabling default options such as
    `--debug` to appear in all subparsers.
  * Make symbols + shlibs "discoverable" by pretending they are packager provided
    files. Reuse the detection logic from provider provided files rather than
    "hand-rolling" a similar logic.

debputy (0.1.4) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debputy.pm: Breaking change: The debputy dh sequence now removes the
    following debhelper tools from the sequence:

    - dh_installdirs
    - dh_install
    - dh_installdocs
    - dh_installchangelogs
    - dh_installexamples
    - dh_installman
    - dh_installcatalogs (!)
    - dh_installdebconf (!)
    - dh_installemacsen (!)
    - dh_installinfo
    - dh_installinit (!)
    - dh_installsysusers
    - dh_installsystemd (!)
    - dh_installsystemduser (!)
    - dh_installmenu (!)
    - dh_ucf (!)
    - dh_perl
    - dh_usrlocal (!)
    - dh_installwm (!)
    - dh_strip_nondeterminism (!)
    - dh_dwz (!)
    - dh_strip
    - dh_missing (!)

    At this point, basically any command *after* dh_auto_install (plus
    dh_installdirs, which runs before dh_auto_install) has been removed.
    As a consequence, the `debputy.pm` sequence no longer interacts very
    well with most debhelper sequence addons.  Basically any command
    relying on content in `debian/<pkg>` will no longer work with
    `dh-debputy`.

    Commands marked with (!) has no or almost no replacement support.
    If a package rely on these commands, odds are debputy will be
    unlikely to support that package.  Other commands will have
    support for common cases (similar to debhelper's default behavior).

  * debputy.py: Breaking change: Remove support for services, debhelper
    provided maintscripts and triggers.

  * New migration features:
    - Auto-migrate `debian/tmpfile` to `debian/tmpfiles`
    - Auto-migrate `debian/README.debian` to `debian/README.Debian`.
      (debhelper allowed both, debputy only supports the latter, which
      is the more common variant).
    - Auto-migrate `debian/doc-base.<suffix>` to
      `debian/<pkg>.<suffix>.doc-base`.  Note that debhelper and debputy
      are not aligned on the naming scheme here. Applying this migration
      causes debhelper to no longer see the doc-base files.
    - Auto-migrate common `debian/install`, `debian/docs` and
      `debian/examples` into the `installations` feature (see
      "manifest changes" below).  Some (but not 100%) dh-exec support
      provided as well.
    - Detect `debian/<foo>` files for unsupported debhelper tools or
      where no migration has been written yet and warn about their usage
      affecting the migration.
    - Migration now works with debhelper compat 13 rather than compat 14
      in most cases.  Notable exception being packages that have a
      `debian/pam`, which will still trigger a min compat of 14.

  * manifest changes:
    - Implement `installations` to replace `dh_install`, `dh_installdocs`
      and `dh_installexamples`.  Please see the `Installations` section
      in `MANIFEST-FORMAT.md` for how to use it.   Note that `debputy`
      installations work differently than debhelper when multiple
      patterns match the same path.

  * debputy plugin API: Important changes:
    - Detached paths are now less volatile. Notably, the `path`
      attribute will now always work for plugins.  The `parent_dir`
      attribute should still be avoided however. Additionally, the
      `.lookup` method will now always trigger an exception for a
      detached path (previously, it would "sometimes" trigger the
      exception depending on the path being resolved).
    - Plugins can now choose whether a Packager Provided File (PPF)
      should have name segments or have architecture specific
      segments.  Additionally, the plugin can request that
      `debian/foo` is considered a fallback for all packages for
      a given file.
    - The `BinaryPackagePath` type has been renamed to
      `VirtualPath`.

  * Improve wording in documentation and fix typos various places.
  * Remove `> /dev/null` for `systemd-tmpfiles`.
  * Add support for systemd's sysusers file.
  * Provide standard excludes for commonly unwanted things
  * Support pruning changelog files. When pruning NEWS, keep only entries listed
    in the Debian changelog.
  * Ensure man, info pages, changelog files and Debian.NEWS files are always
    compressed.  Previously, these would only be compressed if they had a
    certain size. This change makes `debputy` match `dh_compress` better.
  * migration: Renames count as successful changes.  Previously, the migration
    tool would say it could do renames and then claim nothing could be done
    followed by not doing anything at the end.
  * Fix bug where mode was used as mtime for symlinks.
  * manifest/parser: Recognise -dbgsym packages.  The package names
    are now known and will not trigger an "unknown" package
    exception when used. However, currently no directives are allowed
    for dbgsym packages so the net result of specifying them is still
    an error.
  * Migrate to the python logging.  Along with a dependency on colorlogs,
    this means that output will have some color support. This changes means
    more "info" level messages now have basic colors.
  * util.py: Fix double quote handling when doing shell escapes.
  * debputy.py: Improve error reporting a bit.  Notably, previously
    some exceptions that should have been caught and rendered in a
    user-friendly way now are as intended.  Additionally, the debputy
    frontend now catches a common cause of exceptions (`RuntimeError`)
    and classifies them as "Unexpected exceptions" along with a note
    recommending filing a bug for debputy.
  * debputy.py: Hide unstable/internal commands.  Most of the frontend
    commands are now hidden behind an `internal-command` subcommand.
    this means that the default help output now only uses 1-2 lines on
    the internal or unstable subcommands.
  * debputy.py: Provide a `check-manifest` command to parse the manifest
    and check for obvious errors without having to build debs.
  * Do not mandate dpkg archs to be known. Previously, debputy
    would trigger an error if the manifest in the `arch-matches`
    condition listed an unknown dpkg arch.  This error has been
    removed as it is common practice to list new architectures
    long before dpkg in stable/oldstable knows the architecture.
  * Tweak the auto-generated maintscripts. Notably, indentation
    is now two spaces and applied better to avoid weird hanging
    lines. Additionally, the first line of a snippet is no longer
    accidentally merged into the condition line, which could
    cause syntax errors if the fixed line did not have
    indentation.
  * Detect and register python byte compilation for public
    dist-packages dirs and default "package private" dirs
    similar to `dh_python3`.  This is done because `debputy`
    cannot rely on `dh_python3` when it is self-hosting.
    Other `dh_python3` are not ported.
  * Move all of dh-debputy's files from `usr/share/debputy`
    to `usr/share/dh-debputy`. In tandem with the previous
    change, this causes debputy now to properly integrate with
    the python byte compilation system.
  * Correct the "inner" snippet order of generated maintscripts.
    All postrm and prerm snippets are supposed in reverse order
    and previously some snippets were not reordered correctly.
  * migrate-from-dh: Reduce the output to make warnings less likely
    to drown in other output.
  * migrate-from-dh: Better error reporting on failed executable
    dh config emulation.
  * migrate-from-dh: Require an explicit --apply-changes for
    migrations to performed.

debputy (0.1.3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debputy.pm: Breaking change: The debputy dh sequence now removes the
    following debhelper tools from the sequence:
    - dh_lintian
    - dh_bugfiles
    - dh_compress (note: hardlinks are not supported correctly)
  * Create a basic plugin API infrastructure and move some of the
    debputy into a plugin. Plugins can currently register packager
    provided files (`d/pkg.foo -> usr/.../pkg[.conf]`) and detection
    (and generation) of maintscript snippets, substvars and triggers.
    However, plugins cannot alter the contents of the data.tar.
    Additionally, the plugins are not loaded deterministically during
    builds (unclean chroot can load too many plugins), so they are not
    ready for prime time yet.
  * Fixed a bug in debputy's handling of icon-cache generation
    (dh_icons).
  * Detect kernel modules under /usr in addition to /lib.
  * debputy.py: When migrating from dh, detect use of `=>` in
    debhelper config files and report it as unsupported. The migrator
    would not generate the correct code for these lines. Currently,
    none of the debhelper tools where you can use `=>` would be migrated,
    so this is just future proofing.
  * debputy.py: Provide a `plugin` subcommand to interact with the
    plugins.  Currently, it can only list plugins and a bit of the
    content they provide.
  * all frontends: Show colorized error and warning messages similar to
    debhelper.
  * all frontends: Provide a `--version` that prints the version of
    debputy.
  * debputy.py: Detect `/usr/local` paths and abort as they are unhandled.
    Note that `dh_usrlocal` would normally be run and clean up these
    directories, so this is only an issue if you bypass `dh_usrlocal` or
    ask debputy to create content in `/usr/local`.

debputy (0.1.2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * debputy.pm: Breaking change: The debputy dh sequence now removes the
    following debhelper tools from the sequence:
    - dh_installudev
    - dh_installgsettings
    - dh_makeshlibs
  * debputy.py: Breaking change: The manifest use `{{X}}` rather than
    `${X}` for substitution and remove support for environment variables
    in substitutions.
  * deb_packer.py: Support most of the dpkg-deb environment variables for
    compress settings (etc.).  Only known omission is thread count, which
    despite having a `--threads-max` option, `deb_packer.py` ignores the
    value in the name of compatibility.
  * deb_packer.py: Reset the `mtime` of control.tar members according
    to the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH rules (clamping).  Previously, the `mtime`
    was unconditionally reset.  Most control.tar members are
    generated at runtime, so it only mattered when the control file
    is not generated.
  * deb_materialization.py: New internal command for materializing the
    data.tar part of the deb before assembly (or debugging). The
    command can also be used to assembling the materialized deb by
    using dpkg-deb or deb_packer.py (referred to as `debputy`).
  * debputy.py: Default to using `deb_materialization.py` to
    materialize the package and then assemble it with dpkg-deb where
    possible. However, automatically fallback to the internal assembly
    method when (fake)root is required and `Rules-Requires-Root` is
    `no`.
  * debputy.py: When using the `migrate-from-dh` subcommand, use
    `dh_assistant` to detect override targets that might cause issues
    with the migration.
  * debputy.py: Rename `show-manifest-changes` to `show-manifest-rules`
    and `--show-implicit-changes` to `--show-implicit-rules`.
  * builtin_manifest_rules.py: Correct permission for two bugreport
    builtin rules when matching a directory.  Previously, the
    directories would keep their file system mode. Now they are
    correctly normalized to 0755 as other directories would have been.
  * manifest_conditions.py: Fix a bug where the description of build
    profile conditionals where rendered poorly.
  * packages.py: Prevent assertion error when user provides a typo'ed
    package name for `-p`.
