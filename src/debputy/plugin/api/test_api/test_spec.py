    This method will generate a virtual file system a list of path names or virtual path definitions.  It will
    also insert any implicit path required to make the file system connected.  As an example:

        >>> fs_root = build_virtual_file_system(['./usr/share/doc/package/copyright'])
        >>> # The file we explicitly requested is obviously there
        >>> fs_root.lookup('./usr/share/doc/package/copyright') is not None

        This method is useful for verifying that the `installed_path` and `post_formatting_rewrite` works
        as intended. As example, some programs do not support "." in their configuration files, so you might
        have a post_formatting_rewrite Ã  la `lambda x: x.replace(".", "_")`.  Then you can test it by
        calling `assert rppf.compute_dest("python3.11")[1] == "python3_11"` to verify that if a package like
        `python3.11` were to use this packager provided file, it would still generate a supported file name.

        For the `assigned_name` parameter, then this is normally derived from the filename. Examples for
        how to derive it:

          * `debian/my-pkg.stem` => `my-pkg`
          * `debian/my-pkg.my-custom-name.stem` => `my-custom-name`

        Note that all parts (`my-pkg`, `my-custom-name` and `stem`) can contain periods (".") despite
        also being a delimiter. Additionally, `my-custom-name` is not restricted to being a valid package
        name, so it can have any file-system valid character in it.

        For the 0.01% case, where the plugin is using *both* `{name}` *and* `{owning_package}` in the
        installed_path, then you can separately *also* set the `owning_package` attribute.  However, by
        default the `assigned_named` is used for both when `owning_package` is not provided.

        :param assigned_name: The name assigned.  Usually this is the name of the package containing the file.
        :param assigned_priority: Optionally a priority override for the file (if priority is supported). Must be
          omitted/None if priorities are not supported.
        :param owning_package: Optionally the name of the owning package.  It is only needed for those exceedingly
          rare cases where the `installed_path` contains both `{owning_package}` (usually in addition to `{name}`).
