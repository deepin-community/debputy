            >>> pg = ParserGenerator()
            >>> parser = pg.generate_parser(TargetType, source_content=SourceType)

        In this example, the user can provide either `source` or `sources` and the parser will
        map them to the `sources` attribute in the `TargetType`.  Note this example relies on
        the builtin mapping of `str` to `List[str]` to align the types between `source` (from
        SourceType) and `sources` (from TargetType).

        The following rules apply:

         * All source attributes that map to the same target attribute will be mutually exclusive
           (that is, the user cannot give `source` *and* `sources` as input).
         * When the target attribute is required, the source attributes are conditionally
           mandatory requiring the user to provide exactly one of them.
         * When multiple source attributes point to a single target attribute, none of the source
           attributes can be Required.
         * The annotation can only be used for the source type specification and the source type
           specification must be different from the target type specification.

        The `target_attribute` annotation can be used without having multiple source attributes. This
        can be useful if the source attribute name is not valid as a python variable identifier to
        rename it to a valid python identifier.

        In this example, if the user was to provide `renamed_to` with `sources` or `into_dir` the parser would report
        an error. However, the parser will allow `renamed_to` with `source` as the conflict is considered only for
        the input source. That is, it is irrelevant that `sources` and `sourceÂ´ happens to "map" to the same target
        attribute.

        The following rules apply:
          * It is not possible for a target attribute to declare conflicts unless the target type spec is reused as
            source type spec.
          * All attributes involved in a conflict must be NotRequired.  If any of the attributes are Required, then
            the parser generator will reject the input.
          * All attributes listed in the conflict must be valid attributes in the source type spec.

        Note you do not have to specify conflicts between two attributes with the same target attribute name.  The
         `target_attribute` annotation will handle that for you.

        By default, `debputy` will pick up attributes that uses path names (FileSystemMatchRule) as
        candidates for parse error hints (the little "<Search for: VALUE>" in error messages).

        Most rules only have one active path-based attribute and paths tends to be unique enough
        that it helps people spot the issue faster. However, in rare cases, you can have multiple
        attributes that fit the bill. In this case, this hint can be used to "hide" the suboptimal
        choice. As an example:

        In this case, without the hint, `debputy` might pick up `install_as` as the attribute to
        use as hint for error reporting. However, here we have decided that we never want `install_as`
        leaving `source` as the only option.

        Generally, this type hint must be placed on the **source** format. Any source attribute matching
        the parsed format will be ignored.

        Mind the asymmetry: The annotation is placed in the **source** format while `debputy` looks at
        the type of the target attribute to determine if it counts as path.
